# RFC 005: Inject Initializer and Service Mesh in Contrast CLI

## Problem

Currently, the `generate` command in the Contrast CLI doesn't include the functionality to automatically inject the Contrast initializer and service mesh components into the user's Kubernetes YAML resources. This poses several challenges for users: they need to manually copy and paste initializer and service mesh configurations from the documentation into their YAML files, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and disrupts the workflow. They have to keep checking that they're using versions of the initializer and service mesh images that are compatible with their version of Contrast, and update them manually when these components change across versions. This leads to maintenance overhead and inconsistencies. Automating the injection of the initializer and service mesh components provides a simpler, more streamlined experience.

## Proposed Solution

### Initializer Injection

 By default, the `generate` command will iterate through the pod specs in the provided YAML files and for each pod spec that has the `contrast-cc` runtime class set, an init container with the Contrast initializer image will be added before any other existing containers in the pod spec.
 We will then provide two mechanisms for users to opt-out of the initializer injection.

- **Per object (annotation)**: Allow users to opt-out on a per-object basis by adding an annotation (like `contrast.edgeless.systems/skip-initializer`) to the Kubernetes object.
- **Per `contrast generate` (command-line flag)**: Users can opt-out of initializer injection for an entire `generate` invocation by providing the `--skip-initializer` flag. If this flag is set, the initializer won't be injected into any pod spec whatsoever.

#### Ensuring Reliable Initializer Image Embedding

  We need to ensure that the Contrast always uses the correct version of the initializer image that's compatible with the current version.

During the release build process, the `packages/by-name/cli-release/package.nix` file will be updated to embed the published initializer image reference into the Contrast binary. For development builds, we can use an `--image-replacements` flag to specify a file containing image replacements. This flag will be marked as hidden using `pflag.MarkHidden()`, as it's not intended for regular user consumption.

Here is a proposed way to do this that optimizes for the common case where most workloads will use the Contrast initializer, but still provides flexibility for users to opt-out at different levels of granularity:

1. Add `--image-replacements` string and `--skip-initializer` Boolean flags to the `generateFlags` struct and `parseGenerateFlags` function in `cli/cmd/generate.go`. In `runGenerate`, after updating the policies, check the value of the `--skip-initializer` flag.

   - If the flag is set to true, skip the initializer injection process entirely and proceed with writing the updated YAML files.
   - If the flag is set to false or not provided, proceed with the per-object annotation checks.

2. Iterate over the un-marshalled K8s resources:

   - If the pod has the `contrast.edgeless.systems/skip-initializer` annotation, skip injection for that specific pod spec.
   - If the pod spec doesn't have the skip annotation, proceed with injection by calling an `injectInitializer` function (to be written, which can use `kuberesource.Initializer` and `kuberesource.PatchImages`) with the pod spec and the selected initializer image reference, or a default one if the `--image-replacements` flag isn't set. If any existing `initContainers` have the same name as the Contrast initializer, the existing init container will be updated with the injected Contrast initializer as described in the edge cases.

3. Re-encode and write the updated YAML.

#### Edge cases

To make `contrast generate` idempotent and handle potential edge cases, we will implement the following behavior:

1. *Container name conflict:*
   - Use a highly unique name for the initializer container, like `contrast-initializer-container.` This virtually eliminates the chances of name conflicts with user containers.
   - If an `initContainer` with the same unique name already exists, overwrite it with the current version of the Contrast initializer.
   - If no matching `initContainer` is found, inject a new one using the current version of the Contrast initializer and the unique name.
   - If other `initContainers` exist, insert the Contrast initializer as the first one in the list.

2. *Volume Name Conflict:*
   - Use a highly unique name for the volume used by the Contrast initializer, such as `contrast-tls-certs-volume.` This reduces the chances of name conflicts with existing volumes.
   - If a pod spec already contains a volume with the same unique name, no action will be taken, and the existing volume will be reused.

### Service Mesh Injection

The service mesh injection will follow a similar approach to the initializer injection outlined, possibly with additional configuration for labels for service discovery/ports. Details of the service mesh injection will be expanded in a future PR update to this RFC.

### UX Considerations

- Document the injection behavior in the command's help text and docs,  particularly how the command-line flag and annotations interact and which takes precedence.
- Provide logging and error messages in case of failures during the injection process.
- Add an `--output` flag to allow Unix pipeline capabilities. Standard behavior for such flags seems to be:
  - If not provided, `generate` command will as before write the updated YAML files back to disk, overwriting the original file.
  - If `--output` is set to `-`, `generate`  will write the updated YAML to `stdout`.
  - If `--output` is set to a file path, write the updated YAML to the specified file.
