# Coordinator Recovery

## Problem

Restart currently causes loss of

- CA root & mesh key
- Active manifest
- Manifest & policy history

## Requirements

After a full restart of the coordinator, the workload owner needs to be able to recover the coordinator such that:

- A data owner calling `contrast verify` receives the same information they did before the restart.
- A workload certificate issued by the coordinator after the restart verifies with the bundles issued before the restart, and vice-versa.

The design should accommodate a future extension allowing for multi-party recovery.

## Design

The overall idea of this proposal is to derive state deterministically from non-sensitive information and a secret seed.

### State Transitions

The immutable state of a Contrast deployment is the root CA certificate and key, which is derived from the secret seed.

The mutable state consists of the active manifest, a reference to the last state and the mesh CA certificate and keys.
There's a special state $S_0$ that represents an uninitialized Coordinator, which is the same for all Coordinators.

A state transition is initialized by calling the `SetManifest` endpoint with a new manifest and policies.
On update, a new mesh CA key is derived from the manifest history (including the new manifest) and the transition event is persisted.
States thus form a backwards linked list, which can be reconstructed from a list of state transitions, and the last state transition uniquely identifies the current state.
Therefore, we can replace the _last state_ reference with a reference to the _last state transition_.

The list of state transitions needs to be checked for integrity.
Otherwise, an attacker that can manipulate the transition objects can set arbitrary manifests.
Therefore, we sign each state transition with a key derived from the secret seed.

Thus, the final transition object is assembled like this:

```go
manifest := {
  content: manifest_bytes,
  ref: hash(manifest_bytes),
}
transition := {
  manifest: manifest.ref,
  prev: prev.ref, // or empty, which means S_0
  ref: hash(manifest.ref || prev.ref),
  sig: sign(hash(manifest.ref || prev.ref)),
}
```

### Security

We need to provide security for the two different trust models supported by Contrast: the one where the workload owner is trusted
by the data owner and allowed to update the manifest. In this scenario, a data owner will use the Coordinator root CA certificate
to verify the service certificate. In the second scenario, the data owner will verify any update to establish trust in the workload
and thus only trust the mesh CA certificate.

**Scenario 1:** The transaction signing key is derived from the secret seed of the workload owner. Transactions are chained together.
Through the signing, the transactions are authenticated and integrity protected with the signing key and thus with the seed secret
only known to the workload owner. Through the chaining, any manipulation or reordering of the manifest history is prevented.

**Scenario 2:** The mesh CA key is deterministically derived from the seed, the history of transactions and the active manifest.
After recovery, this key can be derived again given the secret seed and the history. In this scenario, the integrity of the history
isn't relevant to the data owner. The data owner still has the mesh CA certificate from before the restart. Given a correct history,
the key of the Coordinator will match the users cert. If history was tampered with, it won't. Any alternation of the manifest history
by either the workload owner or an attacker won't lead to the same public key and thus won't be trusted by the data owner.

### Cryptography

This proposal relies heavily on the idea of deterministic key generation.
Since the generated keys will be used for TLS, the choice of algorithms is limited to what's usually supported by TLS implementers.
The most restrictive applicable standard is the [Baseline Requirements](https://cabforum.org/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-BR-v2.0.0.pdf) for browsers, which require TLS certificates to use ECDSA or RSA keys.
Although the Go standard library doesn't support deterministic generation of these key types, standards-based alternatives are available: <https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/keygen#ECDSA>.

The transition signatures don't need to be deterministic, so we can derive an ECDSA key from the seed to sign transitions.

### Persistent State

We're going to store the following types of objects:

- Policies
- Manifests
- Transitions
- _Head_: a reference to the "last applied" transition

All but the last type are content-addressable: their reference is completely determined by their content.
This makes for some nice properties, like idempotent, conflict-free upsert semantics and natural integrity protection.
Updates to the head, however, need to have transaction semantics to deal with concurrency.
This becomes especially important when we want to allow for more than one coordinator instance.
A storage model that matches our needs is a transactional key-value store.

There are two built-in options for storage in a Kubernetes cluster: persistent volumes and Kubernetes objects.
We propose starting with persistent volumes, because they require less business logic (operator boilerplate) in the Coordinator.
Modelling the volume with a KV interface allows for future replacement of the backend.
The [appendix](#appendix) discusses some options for storage layouts.

As of 2024-05-07, persistent volumes on AKS CoCo are only supported in [`volumeMode: block`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#raw-block-volume-support).
This is sufficient for our use case - we can set up a filesystem when we need one.
The upside of using a block device is that we can easily set it up as a LUKS volume after generating the seed.
This allows us to keep the content of the manifests secret, which isn't critical but still desirable.

### Recovery

On startup, the Coordinator checks whether the block device contains a LUKS header.
If a header is found, it enters into recovery mode, otherwise into normal mode.

#### Recovery Mode

While in _recovery mode_, all calls to `SetManifest` are rejected.
This prevents accidental or malicious overwrites of the Coordinator's storage (a coordinator in $S_0$ accepts manifests from anybody).

Instead, the Coordinator waits for calls to a newly added `Recover` method.
This method accepts the seed and tries to mount the encrypted volume.
If this is successful, it starts the recovery process by deriving the root CA key and the signing key.

The Coordinator loads the head transition from persistence and follows the back references to $S_0$.
Then, starting from $S_0$, it checks the signature for each transaction and applies it.
Finally, it enters _normal mode_.

#### Normal Mode

While in _normal mode_, all calls to `Recover` are rejected.
The Coordinator waits for the first call to set, which generates the secret seed.
During that call, it sets up the volume, filesystem and directory structure.

## Future Considerations

### Secret Sharing

The manifest could be modified to include a recovery threshold parameter.
If the threshold `n` is greater than 1, the response includes secret shares instead of the full secret.
Recovery would need to be called `n` times with different shares.
The threshold would be stored in plain text on the `Contrast` object.
This is fully backwards compatible with the main proposal.

### KMS Recovery

Any KMS built for Contrast would require a bootstrap secret, similar to a [Vault sealing key](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/seal).
Such a key could be derived from the secret seed, bound to the policy of the KMS.
Recovery of the KMS could then simply be a step in the initialization process.
This scheme could be directly applied to user workloads, too (unlocking encrypted persistent storage, for example).

### Distributed Coordinator & Updates

If there is more than one Coordinator instance, the recovery process could be automatic.
After entering _recovery mode_, the Coordinator could request the secret seed from a Coordinator in _normal mode_, subject to successful attestation.
In order to avoid distributed state, the storage backend should then be swapped out with a centralized alternative.

An updated Coordinator instance would start in _recovery mode_ like a restarted instance, and manual recovery would work exactly the same.
Automatic recovery of updated Coordinators is undesirable due to the change in attestation evidence.

## Appendix

### Storage Interface

The common interface to persistent storage is a key-value interface with get and set operations.
Implementations of the interface need to support compare-and-set operations on the head transaction:
The head can only be updated if the current head is the next head's predecessor.
