# IGVM signing `keygen`

Build instructions for generating a IGVM signing key.
This package contains a python script for generating valid signing keys
for the ID Block of AMD SEV-SNP-enabled VMs.
Such a signing key is needed for the `kata-igvm` package.

# IGVM `snakeoil` key

The `snakeoil` key (`igvn-signing-keygen.snakeoilPem`) is a well-known key used to generate reproducible IGVM files.
In Contrast, we verify the launch digest of SNP-enabled pod-VMs.
This means it's perfectly fine for this key to be known to the public.
In exchange, this allows any third party to produce the same IGVM files from source (bit-by-bit reproducibility).

The term `snakeoil` is commonly used in this context to refer to a key that exists for tools that expect it, without adhering to the same security standards (keeping it secret).
