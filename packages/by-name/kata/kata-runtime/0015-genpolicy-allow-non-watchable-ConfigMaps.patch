Subject: [PATCH] genpolicy: allow non-watchable ConfigMaps

If a ConfigMap has more than 8 files it will not be mounted watchable
[1]. However, genpolicy assumes that ConfigMaps are always mounted at a
watchable path, so containers with large ConfigMap mounts fail
verification.

This commit allows mounting ConfigMaps from watchable and non-watchable
directories. ConfigMap mounts can't be meaningfully verified anyway, so
the exact location of the data does not matter, except that we stay in
the sandbox data dirs.
