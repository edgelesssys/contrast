# Service Mesh

The Contrast service mesh secures the communication of the workload by automatically
wrapping the network traffic inside mutual TLS (mTLS) connections. The
verification of the endpoints in the connection establishment is based on
certificates that are part of the
[PKI of the Coordinator](../architecture/certificates.md).

The service mesh can be enabled on a per-workload basis by adding a service mesh
configuration to the workload's object annotations. During the `contrast generate`
step, the service mesh is added as a [sidecar
container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/) to
all workloads which have a specified configuration. The service mesh container first
sets up `iptables` rules based on its configuration and then starts
[Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) for TLS origination and termination.

## Configuring the Proxy

The service mesh container can be configured using the following object annotations:
- `contrast.edgeless.systems/servicemesh-ingress` to configure ingress.
- `contrast.edgeless.systems/servicemesh-egress` to configure egress.
- `contrast.edgeless.systems/servicemesh-admin-interface-port` to configure the Envoy
  admin interface. If not specified, no admin interface will be started.

If you aren't using the automatic service mesh injection and want to configure the
service mesh manually, set the environment variables `EDG_INGRESS_PROXY_CONFIG`,
`EDG_EGRESS_PROXY_CONFIG` and `EDG_ADMIN_PORT` in the service mesh sidecar directly.

### Ingress

All TCP ingress traffic is routed over Envoy by default. Since we use
[TPROXY](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/tproxy.html), the destination address
remains the same throughout the packet handling.

Any incoming connection is required to present a client certificate signed by the
[mesh CA certificate](../architecture/certificates.md#usage-of-the-different-certificates).
Envoy presents a certificate chain of the mesh
certificate of the workload and the intermediate CA certificate as the server certificate.

If the deployment contains workloads which should be reachable from outside the
Service Mesh, while still handing out the certificate chain, disable client
authentication by setting the annotation `contrast.edgeless.systems/servicemesh-ingress` as
`<name>#<port>#false`. Separate multiple entries with `##`. You can choose any
descriptive string identifying the service on the given port for the
informational-only field `<name>`.

Disable redirection and TLS termination altogether by specifying
`<name>#<port>#true`. This can be beneficial if the workload itself handles TLS
on that port or if the information exposed on this port is non-sensitive.

The following example workload exposes a web service on port 8080 and metrics on
port 7890. The web server is exposed to a 3rd party end-user which wants to
verify the deployment, therefore it's still required that the server hands out
it certificate chain signed by the mesh CA certificate. The metrics should be
exposed via TCP without TLS.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web
  annotations:
    contrast.edgeless.systems/servicemesh-ingress: "web#8080#false##metrics#7890#true"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: contrast-cc
      containers:
        - name: web-svc
          image: ghcr.io/edgelesssys/frontend:v1.2.3@...
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: web
            - containerPort: 7890
              name: metrics
```

When invoking `contrast generate`, the resulting deployment will be injected with the
Contrast service mesh as an init container.

```yaml
# ...
      initContainers:
        - env:
            - name: EDG_INGRESS_PROXY_CONFIG
              value: "web#8080#false##metrics#7890#true"
          image: "ghcr.io/edgelesssys/contrast/service-mesh-proxy@sha256:..."
          name: contrast-service-mesh
          restartPolicy: Always
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add:
                - NET_ADMIN
            privileged: true
          volumeMounts:
            - name: contrast-tls-certs
              mountPath: /tls-config
```

Note, that changing the environment variables of the sidecar container directly will
only have an effect if the workload isn't configured to automatically generate a
service mesh component on `contrast generate`. Otherwise, the service mesh sidecar
container will be regenerated on every invocation of the command.

### Egress

To be able to route the egress traffic of the workload through Envoy, the remote
endpoints' IP address and port must be configurable.

* Choose an IP address inside the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR and a port not yet in use
by the pod.
* Configure the workload to connect to this IP address and port.
* Set `<name>#<chosen IP>:<chosen port>#<original-hostname-or-ip>:<original-port>`
as the `contrast.edgeless.systems/servicemesh-egress` workload annotation. Separate multiple
entries with `##`. Choose any string identifying the service on the given port as
`<name>`.

This redirects the traffic over Envoy. The endpoint must present a valid
certificate chain which must be verifiable with the
[mesh CA certificate](../architecture/certificates.md#usage-of-the-different-certificates).
Furthermore, Envoy uses a certificate chain with the mesh certificate of the workload
and the intermediate CA certificate as the client certificate.

The following example workload has no ingress connections and two egress
connection to different microservices. The microservices are themselves part
of the confidential deployment. One is reachable under `billing-svc:8080` and
the other under `cart-svc:8080`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web
  annotations:
    contrast.edgeless.systems/servicemesh-egress: "billing#127.137.0.1:8081#billing-svc:8080##cart#127.137.0.2:8081#cart-svc:8080"
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: contrast-cc
      containers:
        - name: currency-conversion
          image: ghcr.io/edgelesssys/conversion:v1.2.3@...
```
