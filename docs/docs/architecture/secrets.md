# Secrets & recovery

When the Coordinator is configured with the initial manifest, it generates a random secret seed.
From this seed, it uses an HKDF to derive the CA root key and a signing key for the manifest history.
This derivation is deterministic, so the seed can be used to bring any Coordinator to this Coordinator's state.

The secret seed is returned to the user on the first call to `contrast set`, encrypted with the user's public seed share owner key.
If no seed share owner key is provided, a key is generated and stored in the working directory.

## Persistence

The Coordinator runs as a `StatefulSet` with a dynamically provisioned persistent volume.
This volume stores the manifest history and the associated runtime policies.
The manifest isn't considered sensitive information, because it needs to be passed to the untrusted infrastructure in order to start workloads.
However, the Coordinator must ensure its integrity and that the persisted data corresponds to the manifests set by authorized users.
Thus, the manifest is stored in plain text, but is signed with a private key derived from the Coordinator's secret seed.

## Recovery

When a Coordinator starts up, it doesn't have access to the signing secret and can thus not verify the integrity of the persisted manifests.
It needs to be provided with the secret seed, from which it can derive the signing key that verifies the signatures.
This procedure is called recovery and is initiated by the workload owner.
The CLI decrypts the secret seed using the private seed share owner key, verifies the Coordinator and sends the seed through the `Recover` method.
The Coordinator recovers its key material and verifies the manifest history signature.

## Workload Secrets

The Coordinator provides each workload a secret seed during attestation.
This secret can be used by the workload to derive additional secrets for example to encrypt persistent data.
Like the workload certificates, it's written to the `secrets/workload-secret-seed` path under the shared Kubernetes volume `contrast-secrets`.

:::warning

The workload owner can decrypt data encrypted with secrets derived from the workload secret.
The workload owner can derive the workload secret themselves, since it's derived from the secret seed known to the workload owner.
If the data owner and the workload owner is the same entity, then they can safely use the workload secrets.

### Secure persistence

Remember that persistent volumes from the cloud provider are untrusted.
Using the workload secret, applications can set up trusted storage on top of untrusted block devices.
The following, slightly abbreviated resource outlines how this could be realized:

This configuration snippet is intended to be educational and needs to be refined and adapted to your production environment.
Using it as-is may result in data corruption or data loss.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: volume-tester
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: my.registry/my-image@sha256:0123...
        command:
        - /bin/sh
        - -ec
        - | # <-- Custom script that mounts the encrypted disk and then calls the original application.
          device=/dev/csi0
          if ! cryptsetup isLuks $device; then
            cryptsetup luksFormat $device /contrast/secrets/workload-secret-seed
            cryptsetup open $device state -d /contrast/secrets/workload-secret-seed
            mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/state
            cryptsetup close state
          fi
          cryptsetup open $device state -d /contrast/secrets/workload-secret-seed

        volumeDevices:
        - name: state
          devicePath: /dev/csi0
        securityContext:
          privileged: true # <-- This is necessary for mounting devices.
      runtimeClassName: contrast-cc
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: state
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
      volumeMode: Block # <-- The requested volume needs to be a raw block device.
```

:::note

This example assumes that you can modify the container image to include a shell and the `cryptsetup` utility.
Alternatively, you can set up a secure mount from a sidecar container inside an `emptyDir` mount shared with the main container.
The Contrast end-to-end tests include [an example] of this type of mount.
