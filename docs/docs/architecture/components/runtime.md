# Contrast Runtime

The Contrast runtime is responsible for starting pods as confidential virtual machines.
This works by specifying the runtime class to be used in a pod spec and by registering the runtime class with the API server.
The `RuntimeClass` resource defines a name for referencing the class and
a handler used by the container runtime (`containerd`) to identify the class.

```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  # This name is used by pods in the runtimeClassName field
  name: contrast-cc-abcdef
# This name is used by the
# container runtime interface implementation (containerd)
handler: contrast-cc-abcdef
```

Confidential pods that are part of a Contrast deployment need to specify the
same runtime class in the `runtimeClassName` field, so Kubernetes uses the
Contrast runtime instead of the default `containerd` / `runc` handler.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  runtimeClassName: contrast-cc-abcdef
  # ...
```

## Node-level components

The runtime consists of additional software components that need to be installed
and configured on every SEV-SNP-enabled/TDX-enabled worker node.
This installation is performed automatically by the [`node-installer` DaemonSet](#node-installer-daemonset).

### Containerd shim

The `handler` field in the Kubernetes `RuntimeClass` instructs containerd not to use the default `runc` implementation.
Instead, containerd invokes a custom plugin called `containerd-shim-contrast-cc-v2`.
This shim is described in more detail in the [upstream source repository](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/tree/3.4.0/src/runtime) and in the [containerd documentation](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/core/runtime/v2/README.md).

### Virtual machine manager (VMM)

The `containerd` shim uses a virtual machine monitor to create a confidential virtual machine for every pod.
On bare metal, Contrast uses [`QEMU`](https://www.qemu.org/).
The appropriate files are installed on every node by the [`node-installer`](#node-installer-daemonset).

### Pod-VM image

Every pod-VM starts with the same guest image.
The root filesystem is read-only and integrity protected using dm-verity.
The verity hash of the root filesystem is passed via the kernel command line and thus part of the launch measurement of the pod-VM.
The image contains the guest components of Kata Containers and Contrast: The Kata Containers agent that creates the sandbox and containers withing the guest,
the Contrast image puller that retrieves and verifies container images, the Contrast secure mount service that can setup an ephemerally encrypted volume for image storage,
as well as the Contrast initdata processor that receives initializing data from the runtime.

### Initdata processor

After completing the boot process, the pod-VM runs the initdata processor.
This program verifies the initdata document that was annotated to the pod and provisioned by the runtime.
If the initdata document matches expectations, the initdata processor writes the [policy](policies.md) to an in-memory filesystem.
The Kata agent is started only after the initdata processor finished.

### Contrast image puller

In addition to the kata agent, every pod-VM also starts Contrast's image puller.
For each container scheduled to run in the pod, the kata agent will request the image puller to pull and mount the corresponding container image.

The image puller verifies the checksums of both the image manifest, as well as of all subsequently pulled image layers against the provided digest.
For this reason, unpinned images aren't supported.

### Contrast secure image store

In order to reduce memory requirements, Contrast supports mounting an [ephemeral volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/) into each pod-VM.
Before first use, the underlying block device issued by Kubernetes is LUKS-encrypted and integrity protected with keys generated inside the pod-VM.
These keys are never persisted or transferred outside of the pod-VM, meaning the volume is only usable from within the specific pod it's attached to, and only for the duration of that pod's lifetime.

:::warning

It's not possible to detect a [specific kind of replay attack][1] by the host system wherein the host replaces the contents of the encrypted block device by a previously captured snapshot of the disk.
Since the snapshot consists purely of ciphertext generated by the pod-VM, it reads as correctly integrity-protected and the pod-VM can't distinguish it from fresh data.

Importantly, this **doesn't** allow a malicious host to decrypt the ciphertext stored on the device or to inject arbitrary data.

The trade-off between reduced resource requirements and a weakened security posture must be evaluated on a per-use-case basis.
See the [secure image store how-to](../../howto/secure-image-store.md) for details on how to configure the feature for your use-case.

## Node installer DaemonSet

The `RuntimeClass` resource above registers the runtime with the Kubernetes api.
The node-level installation is carried out by the Contrast node-installer
`DaemonSet` that ships with every Contrast release.

After deploying the installer, it performs the following steps on each node:

- Install the Contrast containerd shim (`containerd-shim-contrast-cc-v2`)
- Install `cloud-hypervisor` or `QEMU` as the virtual machine manager (VMM)
- Install an IGVM file or separate firmware and kernel files for pod-VMs of this class
- Install a read only root filesystem disk image for the pod-VMs of this class
- Backup any existing `containerd` configuration in the format
  `<containerd-path>/<config-name>.<time>.bak`
- Reconfigure `containerd` by adding a runtime plugin that corresponds to the `handler` field of the Kubernetes `RuntimeClass`
- Restart `containerd` to make it aware of the new plugin

## More on Confidential Containers

Contrast uses some building blocks from [Confidential Containers](https://confidentialcontainers.org) (CoCo), a [CNCF Sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/confidential-containers/) that aims to standardize confidential computing at the pod level.
The project is under active development and many of the high-level features are still in flux.
Contrast uses the more stable core primitive provided by CoCo: its Kubernetes runtime.

## Kubernetes RuntimeClass

Kubernetes can be extended to use more than one container runtime with [`RuntimeClass`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/) objects.
The [Container Runtime Interface](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cri/) (CRI) implementation, for example containerd, dispatches pod management API calls to the appropriate `RuntimeClass`.
`RuntimeClass` implementations are usually based on an [OCI runtime](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec), such as `runc`, `runsc` or `crun`.
In CoCo's case, the runtime is Kata Containers with added confidential computing capabilities.

## Kata Containers

[Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) is an OCI runtime that runs pods in VMs.
The pod VM spawns an agent process that accepts management commands from the Kata runtime running on the host.
There are two options for creating pod VMs: local to the Kubernetes node, or remote VMs created with cloud provider APIs.
Using local VMs requires either bare-metal servers or VMs with support for nested virtualization.
Local VMs communicate with the host over a virtual socket.
For remote VMs, host-to-agent communication is tunnelled through the cloud provider's network.

Kata Containers was originally designed to isolate the guest from the host, but it can also run pods in confidential VMs (CVMs) to shield pods from their underlying infrastructure.
In confidential mode, the guest agent is configured with an [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) policy to authorize API calls from the host.
This policy also contains checksums for the expected container images.
It's derived from Kubernetes resource definitions and its checksum is included in the attestation report.
