# Initializer

Contrast provides an Initializer that handles the remote attestation on the
workload side transparently and fetches the workload certificate. The
Initializer runs as an init container before your workload is started. It
provides the workload container and the [service mesh sidecar](service-mesh.md)
with the workload certificates.

The initializer periodically connects to the
[`coordinator-ready`](coordinator.md#services) service in its own namespace
until it receives a successful response. This means that workload pods with an
initializer will stay in the `Init` phase until a Coordinator manifest is set
that allows their policy.
