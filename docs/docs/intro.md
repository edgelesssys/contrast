# Introduction

Welcome to the Contrast documentation! Contrast makes your Kubernetes deployments confidential by running workloads securely within confidential computing environments.

![Contrast concept](/img/concept.svg)

Contrast is built upon the open-source [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) project.

Contrast provides confidential containers: Kubernetes pods that are executed within confidential micro-VMs, providing strong, hardware-based isolation from the surrounding environment.
You can use your existing containers without modificationâ€”enabling easy adoption through a lift-and-shift approach.

:::tip
Contrast leverages a technology called confidential computing. If you're new to confidential computing, check out our ðŸ“„[whitepaper](https://content.edgeless.systems/hubfs/Confidential%20Computing%20Whitepaper.pdf) for an overview.

## Why use Contrast?

Contrast keeps your data encrypted at all times, ensuring it remains inaccessible from the underlying infrastructure.
It effectively removes the infrastructure providerâ€”including datacenter employees, privileged cloud administrators, cluster operators, and potential attackersâ€”from your trusted computing base (TCB).
This protects your workloads even from sophisticated threats like malicious co-tenants attempting privilege escalation.

Contrast integrates seamlessly into your existing Kubernetes workflows. It can be deployed into your existing Kubernetes cluster, and requires minimal adjustments to your existing processes.

## Key use cases

Contrast provides powerful [security features and benefits](./security.md). Common scenarios include:

- Strengthening container security with hardware-backed isolation
- Securely migrating sensitive workloads from on-premises to cloud environments
- Protecting workloads and data from internal threats, including cluster administrators
- Enhancing trust and security for SaaS offerings
- Streamlining regulatory compliance efforts
- Facilitating secure multi-party data collaboration

## Supported Kubernetes environments

Contrast supports bare-metal setups based on AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX hardware. It also supports managed Kubernetes with hybrid bare-metal nodes.
