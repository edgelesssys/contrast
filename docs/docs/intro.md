# Introduction

Contrast runs confidential container deployments on untrusted Kubernetes at scale.

Contrast is based on the Kata Containers and Confidential Containers projects. Confidential Containers are Kubernetes pods that are executed inside a confidential micro-VM and provide strong hardware-based isolation from the surrounding environment. This works with unmodified containers in a lift-and-shift approach. It currently targets the CoCo preview on AKS.
