# Contrast Runtime

The Contrast runtime is responsible for starting pods as confidential virtual machines.
This works by specifying the runtime class to be used in a pod spec and by registering the runtime class with the apiserver.
The `RuntimeClass` resource defines a name for referencing the class and
a handler used by the container runtime (`containerd`) to identify the class.

```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  # This name is used by pods in the runtimeClassName field
  name: contrast-cc-abcdef
# This name is used by the
# container runtime interface implementation (containerd)
handler: contrast-cc-abcdef
```

Confidential pods that are part of a Contrast deployment need to specify the
same runtime class in the `runtimeClassName` field, so Kubernetes uses the
Contrast runtime instead of the default `containerd` / `runc` handler.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  runtimeClassName: contrast-cc-abcdef
  # ...
```

## Node-level components

The runtime consists of additional software components that need to be installed
and configured on every SEV-SNP-enabled worker node.
This installation is performed automatically by the [`node-installer` DaemonSet](#node-installer-daemonset).

### Containerd shim

The `handler` field in the Kubernetes `RuntimeClass` instructs containerd not to use the default `runc` implementation.
Instead, containerd invokes a custom plugin called `containerd-shim-contrast-cc-v2`.
This shim is described in more detail in the [upstream source repository](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/tree/3.4.0/src/runtime) and in the [containerd documentation](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/core/runtime/v2/README.md).

### `cloud-hypervisor` virtual machine manager (VMM)

The `containerd` shim uses [`cloud-hypervisor`](https://www.cloudhypervisor.org) to create a confidential virtual machine for every pod.
This requires the `cloud-hypervisor` binary to be installed on every node (responsibility of the [`node-installer`](#node-installer-daemonset)).

### `Tardev snapshotter`

Contrast uses a special [`containerd` snapshotter](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/v1.7.16/docs/snapshotters/README.md) ([`tardev`](https://github.com/kata-containers/tardev-snapshotter)) to provide container images as block devices to the pod-VM. This snapshotter consists of a host component that pulls container images and a guest component (kernel module) used to mount container images.
The `tardev` snapshotter uses [`dm-verity`](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html) to protect the integrity of container images.
Expected `dm-verity` container image hashes are part of Contrast runtime policies and are enforced by the kata-agent.
This enables workload attestation by specifying the allowed container image as part of the policy. Read [the chapter on policies](policies.md) for more information.

### Pod-VM image

Every pod-VM starts with the same guest image. It consists of an IGVM file and a root filesystem.
The IGVM file describes the initial memory contents of a pod-VM and consists of:

- Linux kernel image
- `initrd`
- `kernel commandline`

Additionally, a root filesystem image is used that contains a read-only partition with the user space of the pod-VM and a verity partition to guarantee the integrity of the root filesystem.
The root filesystem contains systemd as the init system, and the kata agent for managing the pod.

This pod-VM image isn't specific to any pod workload. Instead, container images are mounted at runtime.

## Node installer DaemonSet

The `RuntimeClass` resource above registers the runtime with the Kubernetes api.
The node-level installation is carried out by the Contrast node-installer
`DaemonSet` that ships with every Contrast release.

After deploying the installer, it performs the following steps on each node:

- Install the Contrast containerd shim (`containerd-shim-contrast-cc-v2`)
- Install `cloud-hypervisor` as the virtual machine manager (VMM)
- Install an IGVM file for pod-VMs of this class
- Install a read only root filesystem disk image for the pod-VMs of this class
- Reconfigure `containerd` by adding a runtime plugin that corresponds to the `handler` field of the Kubernetes `RuntimeClass`
- Restart `containerd` to make it aware of the new plugin
