# AMD SEV-SNP attestation

This page explains details of the AMD SEV-SNP attestation that are especially relevant for the implementation in Contrast.
You should be familiar with [attestation basics](attestation.md).
For more details on SEV-SNP, see the [whitepapers and specifications from AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html).

The key component for attesting AMD SEV-SNP is the Secure Processor (SP).
It measures the confidential VM (CVM) and metadata and returns an attestation report reflecting those
measurements.

## Startup

The SP extends the launch digest each time the hypervisor donates a page to the CVM during startup via `SNP_LAUNCH_UPDATE`. On an abstract level, the launch digest is extended as follows:

```
LD := Hash(LD || Page || Page Metadata)
```

When the Hypervisor calls `SNP_LAUNCH_FINISH`, it provides the SP with the `HOST_DATA`,
the `ID_BLOCK`, and `ID_AUTH` block.

The `HOST_DATA` is opaque to the SP. Kata writes the hash of the kata policy in
this field to bind the policy to the CVM. `HOST_DATA` is later reflected in the
attestation report.

### ID block structure

The ID block contains fields that identify the VM.
The following table shows the fields that are relevant for Contrast.
The complete structure can be found in the SEV Secure Nested Paging Firmware ABI Specification in table 75.

| Field    | Description    | Contrast usage |
| -------- | -------        | ------- |
| LD |   The expected launch digest of the guest.      | Expected launch digest over kernel, initrd, and cmdline of the CVM. |
| POLICY |   The policy of the guest.      |  |

During startup, the SP compares the measurement it calculated to the `LD` in the ID block.
If they don't match, the SP aborts the boot process.
Similarly, if the policy doesn't match the configuration of the CVM, the SP aborts also.

### ID auth structure

The ID auth structure exists to be able to verify the ID block structure.
A CVM image can be started with for example various different policies.
Moreover, the ID block itself can't be verified later, since
it's not part of the attestation report.
The intended use is that a trusted party creates an ECDSA-384 ID key pair
and signs the ID block structure. Both the signature and the public part of the
ID key are then passed via the hypervisor to the SP. The SP verifies the signature and
keeps a SHA-384 digest of the public key. The SP adds this digest in every attestation
report requested by the CVM.

The complete structure can be found in the SEV Secure Nested Paging Firmware ABI Specification in table 76.

| Field    | Description    | Contrast usage |
| -------- | -------        | ------- |
| ID_BLOCK_SIG |   The signature of all bytes of the ID block.      | Constant value of (r,s) = (2,1) |
| ID_KEY |   The public component of the ID key.      | Deterministically derived from the ID block and ID_BLOCK_SIG (see [Anonymous ID block signing](#anonymous-id-block-signing)) |

### Guest policy structure

The guest policy structure is embedded in the ID block in the `POLICY` field.
The complete structure can be found in the SEV Secure Nested Paging Firmware ABI Specification in table 10.

| Field    | Description    | Value on cloud-hypervisor  | Value on QEMU |
| -------- | -------        | -------  | ------- |
| CIPHERTEXT_HIDING_DRAM |   0: Ciphertext hiding for the DRAM may be enabled or disabled. <br />1: Ciphertext hiding for the DRAM must be enabled.      | 0 | 0 |
| RAPL_DIS |   0: Allow Running Average Power Limit (RAPL).  <br />1: RAPL must be disabled     | 0 | 0 |
| MEM_AES_256_XTS |   0: Allow either AES 128 XEX or AES 256 XTS for memory encryption. <br /> 1: Require AES 256 XTS for memory encryption.     | 0 | 0 |
| CXL_ALLOW |   0: CXL can't be populated with devices or memory. <br /> 1: CXL can be populated with devices or memory.     | 0 | 0 |
| SINGLE_SOCKET |   0: Guest can be activated on multiple sockets. <br /> 1: Guest can be activated only on one socket.   | 0 | 0 |
| DEBUG |  0: Debugging is disallowed. <br />  1: Debugging is allowed  | 0 | 0 |
| MIGRATE_MA |  0: Association with a migration agent is disallowed. <br /> 1: Association with a migration agent is allowed.  | 0 | 0 |
| SMT |  0: SMT is disallowed. <br /> 1: SMT is allowed.  | 1 | 1 |
| ABI_MAJOR |  The minimum ABI major version required for this guest to run.  | 0 | 0 |
| ABI_MINOR |  The minimum ABI minor version required for this guest to run.  | 0 | 31 |

## Attestation report

The attestation report is signed by the Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK).
The SP derives this key from the chip unique secret and the following REPORTED_TCB
information:

1. SP bootloader SVN
1. SP OS SVN
1. SNP firmware SVN
1. Microcode patch level

With those parameters, one can retrieve a certificate signing the VCEK from the
AMD Key Distribution Service (KDS) by querying `https://kdsintf.amd.com/vcek/v1/{product_name}/{hwid}?{params}`

This VCEK certificate is signed by the AMD SEV CA certificate, which is signed by the AMD Root CA.

```
AMD Root CA --> AMD SEV CA --> VCEK -- signs --> Report
```

The Contrast CLI embeds the AMD Root CA and AMD SEV CA certificate.

### Attestation report structure

The following table shows the most important fields of the attestation report and how they're used by Contrast.
The complete structure can be found in the SEV Secure Nested Paging Firmware ABI Specification in table 23.

## Anonymous ID block signing

As described in [startup](#startup), the SP checks the signature of the ID block
with the public key provided in the ID auth block. The common usage of such signatures
is to know that a trusted party holding the private key has signed the ID block.
Since the ID block is part of for example the [IGVM](https://github.com/microsoft/igvm) headers of
the VM image, they're bound to the `runtimeClass` Contrast sets up
during [installation](../getting-started/install.md).
Therefore, the ID auth block and the signature and public key has to be provided by
Contrast, but the authors of Contrast shouldn't be part of the TCB.

To have both the ability to sign ID blocks and not be part of the TCB, we must ensure
that there exists no private key for the `ID_KEY` in the ID auth structure.
For this, we implement ECDSA public key recovery. The algorithm is defined in [SEC 1: Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf).
The algorithm calculates an ECDSA public key given a message and its signature.
We keep the signature constant as `(r,s) = (2,1)` for all versions and
use the given ID block containing the guest policy and launch digest as an input.
The recovery algorithm returns two valid public keys. We choose the smaller one, meaning
the one with the smaller x value and, if equal, the one with the smaller y value.

Since we don't generate any private key material during recovery and calculating the private
key from only the message, signature, and public key is cryptographically hard, no one
can forge (ID block, signature) combinations under the same public key.
