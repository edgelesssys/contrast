# Contrast SDK

**Caution:** This SDK is still under active development and not fit for external use yet.
Please expect breaking changes with new minor versions.

The SDK allows writing programs that interact with a Contrast deployment like the CLI does, without relying on the CLI.

# Building

To build the SDK please add the build tag `contrast_unstable_api` to the importing module's files and build commands.
This tag will be removed once the SDK is officially removed.
