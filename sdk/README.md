# Contrast SDK

**Caution:** This SDK is still under active development and not fit for external use yet.
Please expect breaking changes with new minor versions.

The SDK allows writing programs that interact with a Contrast deployment like the CLI does, without relying on the CLI.

# Building

If you decide to use the unstable API and accept the risk of breakage, you need to set the Go build tag `contrast_unstable_api`.
