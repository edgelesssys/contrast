# AKS Confidential Containers

The Contrast stack on AKS is based on the [AKS Confidential Containers preview].
Azure has support for [nested virtualization](nested-virt-internals) in Hyper-V, which allows spawning CVMs from AKS node VMs.
The preview provides a special node runtime, `KataCcIsolation`, equipped with Microsoft's fork of Kata Containers.

## Sources

The forked code is available at <https://github.com/microsoft/kata-containers>.
The stated goal of Microsoft is to keep the fork somewhat close to upstream, and Microsoft engineers regularly backport selected commits from upstream Kata.
As of 2024-06-26, the codebases have diverged, in particular for the `genpolicy` tool, so that most patches don't apply cleanly.

The `KataCcIsolation` nodes support the runtime class `kata-cc-isolation`, and can be configured to use [debug images](serial-console).

## Compatibility

According to sources at Microsoft, the `KataCcIsolation` nodes are compatible with the most recent version of the `az confcom` extension.
This extension is available at <https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions>.
Judging from the [version selection algorithm], the currently supported version is the latest GitHub release containing `genpolicy`.
