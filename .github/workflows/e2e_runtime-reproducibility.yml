        # As we do not use the Cachix cache containing the artifacts built by developers in this workflow,
        # building the node-installer-image ensures that the whole transitive closure of the packages we build (i.e. everything
        # except what's in cache.nixos.org). Therefore, building this ensures that the kernel, image, IGVM, runtime and the image itself
        # is reproducible across individual builds (as the --rebuild flag is used, causing Nix to rebuild the node-installer-image derivation)
        # and across independent builds on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 (which also test the reproducibility of the transitive closure of our packages, as no shared
        # cache is present between the two machines)
