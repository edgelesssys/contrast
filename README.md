# Nunki

Nunki ([/ˈnʌŋki/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Sagittarii)) runs confidential container deployments
on untrusted Kubernetes at scale.

Nunki is based on the [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers) and
[Confidential Containers](https://github.com/confidential-containers) projects. Confidential Containers are
Kubernetes pods that are executed inside a confidential micro-VM and provide strong hardware-based isolation
from the surrounding environment. This works with unmodified containers in a lift-and-shift approach.

## The Nunki Coordinator

The Nunki Coordinator is the central remote attestation component of a Nunki deployment. It's a certificate
authority and issues certificates for workload pods running inside confidential containers. The Coordinator
is configured with a *manifest*, a configuration file that holds the reference values of all other parts of
a deployment. The Coordinator ensures that your app's topology adheres to your specified manifest. It verifies
the identity and integrity of all your services and establishes secure, encrypted communication channels between
the different parts of your deployment. As your app needs to scale, the Coordinator transparently verifies new
instances and then provides them with mesh credentials.

To verify your deployment, the remote attestation of the Coordinator and its manifest offers a single remote
attestation statement for your entire deployment. Anyone can use this to verify the integrity of your distributed
app, making it easier to assure stakeholders of your app's security.

## The Nunki Initializer

Nunki provides an Initializer that handles the remote attestation on the workload side transparently and
fetches the workload certificate. The Initializer runs as init container before your workload is started.
